## Development Tools

This folder contains helper scripts and tools to assist in the development of the project.

* `run_tests.py`: run all tests in the project. The tests can be found in the `tests/` folder.
* `run_coverage.py`: measure code coverage during execution of the tests, and opens a report in the browser.

(Use `chmod +x ...` if needed to allow these scripts to run.)

Please note that these script were used during development on a Linux system with certain software installed (e.g. Firefox). They are **not intended to be used by the end-user**, and may need to be modified to work on other systems.
